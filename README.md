Exploring Lego Datasets and Solving Some Questions about Star Wars themed sets

In this notebook I explored the data sets as a Data Analyst working at Lego with the Sales/Customer Success teams. 
The Account Executive responsible for the Star Wars partnership has asked for specific information in preparation for their meeting with the Star Wars team. Although Star Wars was critical to the survival of the brand, Lego has since introduced a wide variety of licensed sets over subsequent years.

The two questions are I had to Solve were: 
1. What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed? 
2. In which year was Star Wars not the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)?
